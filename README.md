# Temperature System

Electrical Engineering 1st year project


Measures the temperature and displays it on an 4 digits LCD. It contains 3 buttons that allows you to set a maximum temperature. Once the temperature has exceeded the maximum temperature set by the user, It sets a GPIO pin high. This pin could be connected to a different device such as an ESP to trasmit the information to a different MCU.

Once the user has pressed the "Set Temperature" button, it displays the temperature the user previously set and it can increase it or decrease by pressing either the "Increase Temperature" button or "Decrease Temperature".
