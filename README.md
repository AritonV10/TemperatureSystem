# Temperature System

Electrical Engineering 1st year project


Measures the temperature and displays it on an 4 digits LCD. It contains 3 buttons that allows you to set a maximum temperature. Once the temperature has exceeded the maximum temperature set by the user, It sets a GPIO pin high. This pin could be connected to a different device such as an ESP to trasmit the information to a different MCU.
